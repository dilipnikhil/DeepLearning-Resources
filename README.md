# Deep-Learning-for-NLP-Resources
List of resources to get started with Deep Learning for NLP. (Updated incrementally) 

# Deep Learning (general + NLP) links:
1. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH : This lecture series has very 	 	good introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning.

2. https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets : This lecture series is from Geof Hinton. The concepts 		    explained are bit abstract, concepts are hard to understand in first go. Generally people recommend these 	 lectures as starting point but I am skeptical about it. I would suggest going through 1st one before this.
